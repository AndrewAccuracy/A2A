These used custom interrupt routines to precisely control the sound chip (Paula) at specific intervals.\n    *   **Animation/Video Software:** The Amiga's ability to display smooth, flicker-free animation was partly due to the Zorro bus's quick response to video timing interrupts.\n    *   **Games:** Many Amiga games (e.g., platformers, shooters) used interrupt-driven routines for precise control over sprites and game logic, resulting in smoother gameplay.\n\n*   **Programming Practices:**\n    *   **Custom Interrupt Handlers:** Amiga programmers routinely wrote their own interrupt service routines (ISRs) in assembly language to achieve optimal performance.
