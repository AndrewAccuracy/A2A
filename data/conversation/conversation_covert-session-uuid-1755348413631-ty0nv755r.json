This allowed them to concentrate on pushing the boundaries of graphics processing technology (e.g., 3D acceleration, shader capabilities) without worrying about fundamental compatibility issues. Their innovation in GPU architecture and software (CUDA) was greatly facilitated by not having to deal with numerous, custom hardware interfaces.\n\n*   **Creative Labs:** Creative Labs initially gained dominance with their Sound Blaster cards, which became a de facto standard. However, as integrated audio solutions improved and standardized interfaces like PCI became prevalent, Creative Labs needed to adapt. They were able to focus on high-end audio processing, surround sound technologies, and software enhancements (e.g., EAX) to differentiate their products. They also expanded into other areas like speakers and headphones, capitalizing on the standardized audio output interfaces.\n\nIn essence, standardization fostered a more competitive and innovative environment by lowering the barrier to entry and allowing companies to focus on value-added features and performance.
