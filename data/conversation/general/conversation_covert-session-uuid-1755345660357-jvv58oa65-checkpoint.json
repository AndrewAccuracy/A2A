What specific design decisions or compromises did IBM make to make the PC compatible with a wide range of peripherals and upgrades, and how did this impact the development of the industry as a whole?",
        "normalMessage": "You mentioned that Apple popularized user-friendly PCs and IBM's open architecture allowed for clones and expansion, creating a massive market. I'd like to know more about the roles of other influential companies, such as Commodore and Tandy Radio Shack, in shaping the PC market during this time period. Specifically, how did the decisions made by these companies, such as Commodore's influential VIC-20 and Tandy Radio Shack's TRS-80, impact the development of the PC industry as a whole?",

The market was much bigger than just IBM, and they lost control of the PC architecture to clone makers and other vendors."
