What kind of materials and demonstrations were used to demonstrate the Altair's capabilities, and how did users respond to its introduction? Additionally, how did the success of the Altair influence the business models of companies like Tandy and Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), who were involved in its production and distribution?",
