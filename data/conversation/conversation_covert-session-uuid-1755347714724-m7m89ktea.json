By integrating Japanese motifs into their *own* visual language, they moved beyond simple imitation. Van Gogh used them to express personal emotions, and Monet incorporated them into his explorations of light and atmosphere. This integration, rather than perpetuating a purely \"exotic\" view, subtly undermined it by embedding Japanese elements within Western artistic frameworks, suggesting a cultural exchange rather than a one-sided appropriation, thus blurring the lines of the Orientalist gaze and challenging conventional Western art's boundaries. However, their work also wasn't entirely free from Orientalist undertones, reflecting the complex cultural dynamics of the time.\n"}}], "finalVerification": {"serverAckTimestamp": "2025-08-16T12:35:53Z", "verificationSignal": "timestamp_used_by_server_for_ack", "status": "SUCCESS"}}
