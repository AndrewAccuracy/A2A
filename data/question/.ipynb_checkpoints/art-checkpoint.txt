I'd like to learn about the influence of Japonisme on European Impressionist painters. Can you elaborate on how artists like Van Gogh and Monet absorbed and transformed the compositional and thematic elements of Japanese Ukiyo-e in their works?
I'd like to systematically understand the Bauhaus movement. Can you introduce its core design philosophy, such as 'form follows function', and explain how this philosophy is embodied in the architectural and product designs of key figures like Gropius and Mies van der Rohe? Please provide examples.
I'd like to understand the stylistic evolution from the High Renaissance to the Baroque period. Can you compare the works of a High Renaissance master like Raphael with those of Baroque artists like Caravaggio and Bernini, focusing on aspects like composition, use of light and shadow, and emotional expression?
