I'd like to learn about existentialism. Could you outline the main similarities and differences between the views of philosophers Sartre and Camus, specifically on the core concepts of 'freedom' and 'the absurd'?
I'd like to delve into two major ethical theories: Utilitarianism and Deontology. Can you help me explain the core arguments of Bentham and Kant, respectively? And compare how these two schools of thought would derive different moral conclusions when faced with the classic 'trolley problem'?
I'd like to understand the 'Social Contract Theory'. Can you compare the theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau on key issues such as the state of nature, the source of government legitimacy, and the surrender of individual rights? What are the fundamental differences in their respective theories?
